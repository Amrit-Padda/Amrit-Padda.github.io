                        <h3>SAE Data Acquisition System</h3>
                        <p>
                            This ongoing project is to develop a data acquisition system for our offroad vehicle. It is written in the Arduino language. A few interesting constraints and concerns with the project are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                                <li> The data from the sensors must be read and saved to an IO device with as little latency as possible, hence the system must be "real-time". This was achieved by making individual "slave" devices which recieve data from sensors and forward them onto a CANBUS. A singular "master" device will then listen on the bus for data to arrive and complete the required IO operations. This ensures that the "slave" is not slowed down by the IO process and can transmit data immediately. </li>
                                <li> The system needs to be powered by the engine's alternator, this required me to design a power delivery system which provides a constant voltage to the various devices connected to the system. The engine uses a motorcycle style Stator to convert the rotational motion of the engine to an electrical current. This system leads to the current being generated to resemble a sinusoidal wave, which is not usable by the Arduinos. To solve this, a recifier/regulator is installed between the alternator and the battery. This takes the alternating current coming from the alternator to be converted to a smoother DC voltage. Buck converters were also used to further ensure that the power being delivered to each device is constant and the correct voltage. Arduinos are fairly resistant to power fluctuations, however it is considered a best practice to use an external power regulator. </li>
                                <li> The system must also be embedded and operate in harsh conditions, to solve this problem I designed a 3D printed case to house the various devices </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In the future, the scope of the system will expand to include a suspension sensor package as well as live driver feedback. The focus of the project at the moment is to get engine and gearbox data for our Electronic Transmission Captsone project which is currently under development. </p>
